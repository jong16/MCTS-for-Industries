# MCTS-for-Industries
believe it or not, as and industrial engineering i sometimes feel so confuse when making decisions as my major don't have any heavy technical skills except optimization unlike other engineering major we sometimes use more subjective judgement from expert. so in order to sharping those skills i would like to use MCTS in industrial scenarios.
